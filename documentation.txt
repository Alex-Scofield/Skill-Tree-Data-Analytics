Here is a small reference of the methods to easily access and visualise the SkillTree data.

Note: for all graphs there exists a parameter called tight_layout, which, if set to False deactivates layout optimisation. This can be used if the plots are not displaying properly.

count_users: Takes a dictionary as a parameter to specify which users to count. If left empty, it will return the total number of SkillTree users.
order_skills_by_popularity: Returns an ordered dictionary with each skill as a key and its number of completions as a value. It takes the optional user_parameter parameter to generate a list for specific types of users.
graph_skills_by_popularity: Returns a horizontal bar chart of the most popular skills. It takes an optional user_parameter parameter to specify which types of users to analyse and an amount parameter, to specify the amount of skills to graph (note, if graph_all is set to True, all skills will be displayed).
